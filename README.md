[Here](https://trello.com/b/t9H7Dify/project-2) is the Trello board outlining the original ERD and wireframe for the project, which underwent several changes by the completion of the product.

#### Next Steps

Some of the future plans for this app would include features such as:
1. Including timestamps with each transaction, so that the income statement could be viewed on a monthly or yearly basis.
2. Adding a suppliers model, and creating a relationship between each expense and supplier.
3. Creating a relationship between customers and their purchases.
4. Adding a _type_ parameter to expenses, so that they can be organized more precisely on the income statement.
